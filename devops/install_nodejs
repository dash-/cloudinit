1. Word on the street is that "Trying to manage Node.JS and any of its ecosystem via RPM right now is an exercise in futility"
   That having been said, we're doing a manual install.

	$ sudo su

2. Install openssl-devel (if necessary)

	# yum install openssl-devel

3. Download lastest stable node.js source (currently 0.8.17)
   (The latest stable version is displayed on nodejs.org home page or download page)

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.17/node-v0.8.17.tar.gz
	# tar zxvf node-v0.8.17.tar.gz
	# cd node-v0.8.17

4. Make and install source

	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install
