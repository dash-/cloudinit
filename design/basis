The Cloud Initiative


Mission: Globally change the way web software is organized, designed, implemented, published, and maintained.
         Put another way: Systematically end evil web empires by fostering a positive, open, competitive web ecosystem.

Motto: Create more than you capture. - Tim O'Reilly


How the Cloud Initiative fulfills its mission:

* Provides guidance on what systems should exist
* Provides a mechanism for defining standard versioned system interfaces
* Provides documentation for the implementation of standard versioned system interfaces
* Ensures the existence of a commons for publishing system implementations
* Protects technology from patent-hungry corporations
* Provides guild system for talent-seeking organizations
* Manages universal systems
* Provides highly-networked hosting to service providers to optimize provider-to-provider (Pv2Pv) connectivity
* Enforces service-provider requirements


Universal Services:

* People
	- Register People to a specific People Service Provider (PplSPv)
	- Register move of People from one PplSPv to another
	- Register removal of People from a specific PplSPv
	- Publish People meta-database to Master PplSPv's

* Universal Controls (maybe)
	- Provide javascript to participating Service Providers for Universal Controls to be displayed in their web application
	- Standard but styleable minimized control panel that allows user to:
		- See what user is logged in
		- Log out
		- Act on behalf of:
			- Myself
			- An organization
				- This would require authorization to act on behalf of an organization
		- User preferences
	- This control panel would only call appropriate webservices hosted by user's PplSPv or OrgSPv, as applicable
	- Service providers would systematically be forced to respect user's choices

* UniGuild
	- Based on an abstract base organization
	- NOTE: Even the UniGuild's abstract base organization can be forked,
		      so competition is still possible


Master Services:

* People
	- Retrieve People meta-database from Universal PplSPv
	- Return registered PplSPv of People (lookup by hashed email address)

* Master Guilds


Services:

* Global database resources (DbSPv)
- Graph Database
	- Per node Ppl2Spv & SPv2Ppl authorization
	- Common attributes
		- People owner
		- Organization owner (optional)
		- Permissions model
		- Namespace
		- Database
		- Node class
		- Created timestamp
		- Modified timestamp

* People (PplSPv)
	- Authentication
	- Authorization
		- "People to Service Provider" Authorization (Ppl2SPv Auth)
		- "Service Provider to People Data" Authorization (SPv2Ppl Auth)
	- Personal information
	- Global Preferences
	- Per-Service Preferences
	- Etc.

* Organization (OrgSPv)
	- Organizational hierarchy
	- Members (People)
	- Inherited permissions / data structures
	- Addresses for organization-specific services

* Idea Management (IdeaSPv)

* Guilds (GldSPv)
	- Extends OrgSPv (or an abstract base organization within OrgSPv)
	- Adds specialized organizational software specific to guild services
	- A guild falls under a Master Guild, which falls under the UniGuild
		- The UniGuild is a legitimate organization owned by the Cloud Initiative
		- Master Guilds are legitimate suborganizations within the UniGuild
		- Guilds are legitimate suborganizations within Master Guilds
	- Guilds, Master Guilds, and the UniGuild are NOT labor unions
		- Operating like a labor union (organizing strikes, etc) is strictly prohibited
	- Guilds have names, but cannot contain the word "master".
		- More precisely, cannot match: /[mM][ ]?[aA][ ]?[sS][ ]?[tT][ ]?[eE][ ]?[rR]/
		- Yes, this means a guild cannot be named "Christmas Terms"
		- This requirement about the word "master" is to avoid confusion with Master Guilds
	- Master Guilds

			- User interface design
			- Graphical design

			- Video specialties
			- Audio specialties

		- Vision Master Guild
			- Vision
			- Execution
	- Character sheets
		- (NOTE: Should probably base this more closely off of industrial psychology)
		- Many values, from attributes through role levels, experience points, and more
		  may be boosted by working on organizational projects -- this includes (in particular)
		  open source development projects (although these projects must be performed by
		  organizations that are registered with an Organization Service Provider).
		- Challenges
			- Challenges for novices / skilled guildmembers should be basic skill competencies
			- Challenges for experts / masters can include designing / building / managing useful software
				- This includes building challenges for novices / skilled guildmembers
		- Limited personal information
		- Attributes
			- Potential attribute list:
				- Detail Orientation
				- Operational Speed
				- Learning Speed
				- Resistance to Change
				- Attentiveness
				- Hygiene / Grooming / Presentation
				- Charisma
				- Writing
				- Reading
				- Conversation
				- Topic Focus
				- Helpfulness (frequency with which individual attempts to answer questions / help)
				- General Competency (rated via +1 system)
				- Follow-Through
				- Leadership
				- Humility
				- Cooperativeness
				- Drive
			- May be best organized into expandable categories that may be summed
		- Education / Certifications / Credentials
		- Awards / Special Noteworthies
		- Roles
			- Specialty name (ie Software Engineer)
			- Level
				- Names
					- Novice (N)
					- Skilled (S)
					- Expert's Apprentice (EA)
						- Requires apprenticeship to an expert
						- Expected to be able to rely on expert's advice, knowledge, and/or help
						- Failure of apprentice will reflect poorly on expert
					- Expert (E)
					- Master's Apprentice (MA)
						- Requires apprenticeship to a master
						- Expected to be able to rely on master's advice, knowledge, and/or help
						- Failure of apprentice will reflect poorly on master
					- Master (M)
				- A number could also be included in level.  So, N3 would be better than N2.
				- Various factors are reflected in level
					- Challenge scores
					- Overall experience points
					- Specific role-based experience points
					- Education / Certifications / Credentials
						- Can only bump from Novice to Skilled
					- Other guildmembers
						- If a master/expert says you're skilled, then:
							- If you're a novice, you instantly become skilled (after passing a single challege).
							- If you're an expert, this hurts a tiny bit, but not much.
							- If you're a master, it doesn't mean anything.  But if 3 masters agree, it hurts a little.
						- If a master/expert says you're an expert, then:
							- If you're currently novice, you'll immediately be bumped up to skilled.
							- If you're currently novice or skilled, then you probably are an expert.
							  But their respect isn't enough to just bump you up to expert by itself (but it will help).
							- If you're currently a master, it doesn't mean anything.  But if 2 masters agree, it hurts a little.
						- If a master says you're a master, then:
							- If you're currently novice, you'll be immediately be bumped up to skilled.
							- If you're currently novice or skilled, then you might be a master.
							  But their respect isn't enough to just bump you up to master by itself (but it will help).
						- If an expert says you're a master, then:
							- If you're currently novice, you'll be immediately be bumped up to skilled.
							- If you're currently novice or skilled, then you might be a master.
							  But their respect isn't enough to just bump you up to master by itself (but it will help
							  bump you up to expert).
							- If you're currently an expert, it means nothing unless 3 experts and 1 master agree.
							- (NOTE: It reflects poorly on experts/masters to recommend a level increase if other factors
							  disagree with their assessment).
					- A note on apprenticeships: If an expert or master takes you on as an apprentice, you immediately
					  become an Expert's Apprentice or a Master's Apprentice

Education:
...


Concepts:

* High-level Network / Object-oriented concepts apply where possible
	- An organization could be an extension of an abstract base organization
	- A person's role in the organization could be an extension of an abstract base role
* Forkability / Mergeability
	- An abstract base organization could be forked and altered
		- New organizations could extend the forked abstract base organization
		- Changes to the forked abstract base organization could be merged into the original organization
	- An abstract base organization could be extended as another abstract organization
	- An abstract base class could be the base of people, organizations, and more data structures
* Guilds
	- If the Cloud Initiative is building an ecosystem, then guildmembers are its natives.
	  Other people can still visit, but they're not really first-class citizens.  After all, it is
	  the guilds that provide the workforce to implement the Cloud Initiative.
